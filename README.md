# odin-recipes
This project is made with the intent to review my knowledge of HTML.
It's basically a list of recipes.

After it's completion I can say that I have demonstrated my familiarity with tags and elements, ordered/unordered lists, links and images and using Git to add, commit and push content changes to GitHub and so to add to my portfolio.
